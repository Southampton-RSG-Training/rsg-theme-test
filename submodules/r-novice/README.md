# R for data analysis and visualization

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons are taught over three sessions. They start
with some basic information about syntax for the R programming language, the
RStudio interface, and move through to specific programming tasks, such as
importing CSV files, the structure of data frame objects in R, dealing with
categorical variables (i.e. factors), basic data manipulation (adding/removing
rows and columns), and finishing with calculating summary statistics and a brief
introduction to plotting.

## Prerequisites

> * Having R and RStudio installed, with tidyverse and ggplot2 packages

## Days

1. [Day1](_episodes_rmd/00-day-1.Rmd)
2. [Day2](_episodes_rmd/01-day-2.Rmd)
3. [Day3](_episodes_rmd/02-day-3.Rmd)

## Code handout

There is a [code handout](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/code-handout.R) that is intended to
be distributed to the participants. This file includes some of the examples used
during teaching and the titles of the section. It provides a guide that the
participants can fill in as the lesson progresses. Participants can also source
code from this file to avoid typos in more complex examples.
